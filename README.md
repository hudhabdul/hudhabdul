- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the population of the earth is outnumbered by chickens? There are about 25 billion chickens alive right now, compared to only about 8 billion humans!

That means for every one of us, there are about 3 chickens strutting around somewhere. So next time you see a chicken crossing the road, remember you're in the minority!
